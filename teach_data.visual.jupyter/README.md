# An introduction to Python and Data Science

Language: English
### Timeline
Session I: 9.00--12.00

Break

Session II: 13.00-16.00

### Description
On day one we will build a working knowledge for performing simple data processing of tabular data and generating visualization of data using the programming language Python. The course requires no knowledge of the Python programming language, but a basic programming proficiency is required (your have programmed before). We will first cover basic programming in the Python language and how to work with the Jupyter Notebook tool. This basic part will then be extended with data processing and visualization based in a dedicated data analytics tools named Pandas. The day is organized with lectures and small exercises to be solved individually or in small groups.

### Method
The day is based on [participatory live coding](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/) where the instructor will type in the code with the participants following along. We have good experience with this teaching form. There will also be plenty of small 5 min. exercises.

### Content

1. (1/2 h) Why? workflow? Setting the scene - packages/eco-system - sharing - visibility - literate programming - reproducibility
